# python_reCaptchaBypass


A long time Selenium user, I wondered if it was possible to bypass reCaptcha with Selenium.  

Running on an EC2 server (not locally) was another layer of bot detection that complicated things. I unfortunately ran out of time for this project.

Alas, my failed attempt to beat ReCaptchaV2 on an AWS EC2 server with Ubuntu.
