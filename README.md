# python_reCaptchaBypass

Code from: [How to Easily Bypass ReCaptchaV2 with Selenium](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-easily-bypass-recaptchav2-with-selenium-7f7a9a44fa9e)

A long time Selenium user, I wondered if it was possible. The Medium post is missing code and outdated. I  updated dependencies, finished the code, updated versions. Running on an EC2 server (not locally) was another layer of automation that complicated things. I unfortunately ran out of time for this project.

Alas, my failed attempt to beat ReCaptchaV2 on an AWS EC2 server with Ubuntu.
