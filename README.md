A long time Selenium user, I wondered if it was possible. The Medium post was outdated. I  updated dependencies, versions. However, running on an EC2 server and  not locally was another layer of automation that complicated things. I was on a deadline, and unfortunately, ran out of time for this project.

Alas, my failed attempt to beat ReCaptchaV2 on an AWS EC2 server with Ubuntu.
